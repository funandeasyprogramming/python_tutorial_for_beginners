# Variable Name Restrictions
# Python does not allow a variable that starts with a number
#01_first_name = "Danny"

# You can still use number in between
#first_01_name = "Danny"

# You can still use the number at the end
#fisrt_name_01 = "Danny"

# Python's keyword cannot be used as a variable name
#class = "Something"

# Only underscore _ is allowed as the variable name
#first_name% = "Danny"

#first_name = "Danny"
